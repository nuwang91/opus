@import "include";

// Mixins related to the Arrange component

// The total height of components in a column determines the base height
// of that column. If the columns does not have equal height, the last
// component of the smaller column (unless collapsed) grows to the height
// of the largest one, giving the columns the same height. This to prevent
// "holes" that would otherwise show up in the design.
//
// Fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/uvkorttd/
//
// For this to work, we have to adjust the host and group class
// of supported components.
